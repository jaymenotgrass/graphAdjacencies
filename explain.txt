A. A graph is the right structure to represent a social network because it can handle biodirectional relationships.
    Instead of just a one-way path connecting two objects, there is a path that goes back and forth. There is no hierarchy in a social network, 
    and anybody could be connected to anybody. Using a graph can accomplish this by creating different edges to connect all the nodes. 
B. A list or tree wouldn't work well because a tree only allows certain nodes a certain number of connections and a list would not accurately show
    who is connected to who. A graph allows many connections in many different orders, while trees and lists allow few connections with a specific order. 
C. When adding friends and printing networks, I realized it went alot faster because it would not have to print things out in a certain order. 
    However, with the ability to print quickly, it held more memory because it had to track which people were added already and which friendships within those people 
    were added already. With a list or tree, it can just go straight down, however, with a graph, it has to check everyone connection.
